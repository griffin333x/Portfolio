        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a 22 year old student at NBCC, studying in the Programmer Analyst program. I have a passion for most things technology and love learning new things. I started this program because I was tired of doing things I didn't enjoy, and turns out I'm pretty good at coding!
          I'm also a huge nerd for anything music or video game related.
